## Introduction
This repository contains code and resources for an AI-driven system that explores and predicts company registration trends using data from the Registrar of Companies (RoC). The system utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to analyze and derive insights from company registration data, assisting in understanding and predicting trends in the business landscape.

## Requirements
To run this AI-driven exploration and prediction system, you need the following prerequisites:
- Python 3.6+
- Python libraries specified in the `requirements.txt` file

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/ai-driven-company-registration-trends.git
   cd ai-driven-company-registration-trends
   ```

2. Install the required Python libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
